# Wizard is an autonomous memecoin trader AI Agent
   
Wizard is an autonomous AI agent that analyzes the latest price movements of top memecoins on Base, and considering its current portfolio allocation and asset exposure, decides whether to buy or sell any assets. When it made a decision it autonomously executes the swaps. No human in the loop.
